Bitcoin Price Prediction using Linear Regression model
The objective of the project is to predict the bitcoin price using machine learning algorithm. considering the fact that bitcoin has increasingly regarded as an investment assest. Bitcoin is highly voilatile in nature, becasue of this, there is need for a good prediction on which to base the investment decision.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to find the dependency between the variable. This is done to understand the relationship between the data and found that relative change in variable "x" corresponds to relative change in variable "y"(if we taken "x " as the target variable ie, "Bitcoin Market price" and "y" as the other independent variables).
I have used Linear regression model to predict the bitcoin price. The model is choosen becasue from the exploratory data analysis it has found that there is linear dependency between the variables.
